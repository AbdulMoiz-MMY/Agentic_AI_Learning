# API:
### An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and tools that allow different software applications to communicate and share data or functionality. It acts as a bridge, enabling developers to access specific features or services without needing to understand the underlying code.
#### Example: A chatbot uses OpenAI’s GPT API to send a text input and receive a generated response, enabling conversational AI features in the application. 
# SDK:
### An SDK (Software Development Kit) is a collection of tools, libraries, and documentation that developers use to build applications for specific platforms or frameworks. It simplifies development by providing pre-built components, sample code, and utilities tailored for the target environment.
#### Example: Developers use the OpenAI SDK to integrate AI models like GPT or DALL-E into their applications, providing pre-built tools and libraries for seamless implementation.
# Web API:
###  A Web API is an API accessed over the internet using standard web protocols like HTTP, enabling communication between a client and a server. It allows applications to fetch or send data, often in formats like JSON or XML.
#### Example: A web application uses the Google Maps Web API to retrieve map data and display locations dynamically.
# Library API:
### A Library API is a set of functions and tools provided by a software library that developers use to perform specific tasks within their code. It operates locally within an application, offering reusable components for efficient development.
#### Example: Python’s NumPy library API provides functions like numpy.array() to create and manipulate arrays for numerical computing.
# Prompting and Completion: 
### Prompting and Completion refers to the interaction with AI models where a user provides a prompt (input text), and the model generates a completion (output text) based on the given input. It is fundamental to AI-driven natural language processing tasks like chatbots, text generation, and summarization.
#### Example: Prompt: "Write a poem about the ocean." Completion: "The ocean waves dance under the moonlight, reflecting a world serene and bright..."

# Summarize the all topics:
#### 
#### API: A set of rules enabling different software to communicate and share functionality.
#### Example: A weather app uses an API to fetch live weather data.

#### SDK: A toolkit with libraries, tools, and documentation to build applications for specific platforms.
#### Example: Android SDK is used to develop Android apps.

#### Web API: An API accessed over the internet using HTTP for exchanging data between a client and server.
#### Example: Google Maps Web API retrieves and displays map data.

#### Library API: Functions provided by a software library to perform tasks locally within an application.
#### Example: NumPy’s API offers tools for numerical computations in Python.

#### Prompting and Completion: Providing input text (prompt) to an AI model to generate meaningful output (completion).
#### Example: Prompt: "Tell me a joke." Completion: "Why don’t skeletons fight each other? They don’t have the guts!
