## 1. AI API
What It Is: An AI API is a tool that helps different apps or systems talk to an AI. It can be used for things like generating text, recognizing images, or translating languages.
## 2. APIs in Messaging
What It Is: Messaging APIs help apps send and receive messages. This allows chatbots or other programs to automatically send messages or responses.
## 3. Max Completion Tokens
What It Is: This refers to the maximum number of words (or parts of words) that the AI can produce in a response. The total tokens include both the input and the generated output.
## 4. n (Number of Completions)
What It Is: The n value tells the AI how many different responses to generate for the same question. If n=3, it will give three different answers to choose from.
## 5. Stream
What It Is: Streaming means getting the AI’s response in parts as it is being created. This way, the response shows up faster, instead of waiting for the full answer.
## 6. Temperature
What It Is: Temperature controls how creative or random the AI’s answers will be. A low number (e.g., 0.2) makes the AI stick to safe, common answers. A high number (e.g., 1.0) makes the AI’s answers more creative or unpredictable.
## 7. top_p (Nucleus Sampling)
What It Is: top_p limits the AI’s choices by picking the most likely answers. The higher the top_p, the more choices the AI has, making it more creative. Lower top_p makes the AI pick only the most common answers.
## 8. Tools in AI APIs
What It Is: Tools in AI APIs are extra features that make the AI more powerful. These can help with different tasks, like generating text, understanding language, working with images, or processing data.
### Types of Tools:
#### Text Tools: 
Help with writing, summarizing, translating, or analyzing text.
#### NLP Tools: 
Help the AI understand and break down language, like finding names, words, or sentence parts.
#### Image Tools: 
Help generate images or recognize things in pictures.
#### Code Tools: 
Help write or fix computer code.
#### Integration Tools: 
Help the AI talk to other services, like websites or databases.
#### Speech Tools: 
Convert speech to text or text to speech.
#### Data Tools: 
Help clean up, sort, and analyze data.
#### Special Tools: 
Help with advanced tasks like teaching AI by interaction (reinforcement learning) or controlling robots.
